Basic replication of gfs.py - read/write functionality with separation.  


create_master.py [optional port] to create master on port 1400 or specified port number
create_server.py [optional ip] to connect to a master on localhost by default or to specified ip address

Basic TODO:
sparate create file from write file 
Basic metadata updates before heartbeat implementation?

Advanced TODO:
Replication of files
Chunkserver register saved content with master (needs replication first, otherwise its garbage if the master doesn't know about it)
Consistency model (fix issue with master )
