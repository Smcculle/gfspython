Basic replication of gfs.py - read/write functionality with separation.  


create_master.py [optional port] to create master on port 1400 or specified port number
create_server.py [optional ip] to connect to a master on localhost by default or to specified ip address

Basic TODO:
Extend servers to multiple machines (zookeeper with registration)
add appending?
separate create file from write file 
Basic metadata updates before heartbeat implementation?

Advanced TODO:
Replication of files
Chunkserver register saved content with master (needs replication first, otherwise its garbage if the master doesn't know about it)
heartbeat metadata transfer 
Consistency model
Acquire lease
accurate data deletion and/or garbage collection
